1. Describle the most important book for you.
- The most important book for me is a technical book called Deep Learning, author by Good Fellow, which is an introduction to Artificial Intelligence. 
Without it, I could still be doing the job that I don't like. I was major in Electronic and transferred to a AI Engineer with the helps of this book
It prepares me the fundamental knowledge of AI, which helps me succeed in interviews and finally gets me a opportunity to be an AI engineer.
  On the other hand, the book also gives me a vision of the AI world that arouses my interest in AI research, like how machine learns like a human and when a machine looks at an image, what
does it really see.

2. Some people think television has a more positive effects towards modern society than its negative sides, but others don't agree, what do you think
- In my perspective, television has a more positive effects towards modern society than its negative sides. First, we can embrace other parts of the world
without stepping outside of the house. Such as experience the beautiy of Statue of Liberty and The Great Wall in two minutes. More importantly, it provides a way
to better understand other cultures, like what people of different nationalities think about our country, what is their daily life.
  Second, by watching TV shows and series, we can relax ourselives after a day's of hard work. A comic series could effectively comfort me and makes me forget the intense
  and unhappiness accumulated in daily work.
  
3. Descirbe the most important decision you made in your life.
- The most important decision I made is transferring from Electronic major to AI enginneer, by learning by myself. My parents made the decision for me that applying 
electronic major in college, but it could hardly arouse my interest. Ocassionally, I attended an online course called machine learning, presented by a professor
in stanford, it gives me a vision of the charming AI world. Moreover, AI frequently appears in TV news and daily life, so I realize devoting to AI would be much more
promising than electronics. As an consequence, I finally decided to choose AI as my career.

4. Some people think it's important to teach music and arts in high school as well as other science
- I think we should teach music and arts in high school as well as other scienes, because music and arts are essential components of modern society. High school students would contact music and arts everyday in their daily life, such teenagers like to hear pop music and the clothes they wearing are designd by . Thus, in order to help them to experince the beatuy of music and arts, it's important to teach methodologies of musci and arts in high school.
