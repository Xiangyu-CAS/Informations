- The most important book for me is a technical book called Deep Learning, author by Good Fellow, which is an introduction to Artificial Intelligence. Without it, I could still be doing the job that I don't like. I was major in Electronic and transferred to a AI Engineer with the helps of this bookIt prepares me the fundamental knowledge of AI, which helps me succeed in interviews and finally gets me a opportunity to be an AI engineer.
  On the other hand, the book also gives me a vision of the AI world that arouses my interest in AI research, like how machine learns like a human and when a machine looks at an image, what
does it really see.

2. Some people think television has a more positive effects towards modern society than its negative sides, but others don't agree, what do you think
- In my perspective, television has a more positive effects towards modern society than its negative sides. First, we can embrace other parts of the worldwithout stepping outside of the house. Such as experience the beautiy of Statue of Liberty and The Great Wall in two minutes. More importantly, it provides a way
to better understand other cultures, like what people of different nationalities think about our country, what is their daily life.
  Second, by watching TV shows and series, we can relax ourselives after a day's of hard work. A comic series could effectively comfort me and makes me forget the intense and unhappiness accumulated in daily work.
  
3. Descirbe the most important decision you made in your life.
- The most important decision I made is transferring from Electronic major to AI enginneer, by learning by myself. My parents made the decision for me that applying 
electronic major in college, but it could hardly arouse my interest. Ocassionally, I attended an online course called machine learning, presented by a professor
in stanford, it gives me a vision of the charming AI world. Moreover, AI frequently appears in TV news and daily life, so I realize devoting to AI would be much more
promising than electronics. As an consequence, I finally decided to choose AI as my career.

4. Some people think it's important to teach music and arts in high school as well as other science
- I think we should teach music and arts in high school as well as other scienes, because music and arts are essential components of modern society. High school students would contact music and arts everyday in their daily life, such teenagers like to hear pop music and the clothes they wearing are designd by . Thus, in order to help them to experince the beatuy of music and arts, it's important to teach methodologies of musci and arts in high school.

Second, some students might use cellphone to play games or to chat with their friends in class secretly. 

7. Describe an celebration or an moment that make you impressed
- The most impressive celebration for me is the 70th anniversay of national day. This year, 2019, is the 70th birth day of People's Republic of China. There was a huge celebration in Tiananmen Sqaure in Beijing. Thounds of students from different universities marched to celebrate the Great rejuvenation of Chinese nation. The goverment leader also gave an speech to state the great achievement our nation had made in last decades. When I was watching the celebration, I felt proud of being a Chinese.
But, Ironically, the same day in HK, some rioters marched said it's a shame day of HK. They felt humiliated to be identified as Chinese citizens. It's a nation somewhat divided.

8. Which one acts more influence on you? Newspaper, TV or teachers
- I think it's Television, compared with newspaper and teachers. Newspaper is a product that out of date, there's an hugely decrease on newspaper readers. And once I graduate, teachers can not influence on me anyomre. However, I get informed by television nearly everyday.
On the other hand, watching TV series, especially comedy, helps me to relax myself after a day's of hard working. It's a economic way to entertain us and release pressure accumulated from work.

10. Whether the goverment should assist in building theater and museum? Give your opinion and include specific exmaples and details in your explanations.
- I think the goverments should do more than assisting in building theater and museum, the should dominate it. And that's how most of theaters and museums were build in China, constructed by local goverment. The responsibility of goverment is to benefit citizens in all aspects. Theater and museum servers as the public benefit facilities to preserve arts and history. Our people need to learn history and arts as well as sciences. On the other hand, some theater and museum don't make a lot profits. Companies and private organization might not willing to spending money on constructing them. If goverment dont do a favor to assist in building them, there would not less and less public benefit facilities (of them)

11. Describle a place you like most in your city.
- The place I like most in my city is the Forbidden City, a famous palace for visitors. The Forbidden City is a extremly large palace with hundreds of house, accomodating the loyal families in the past hundreds years.

12. When you are together with friends, which place do you like to go? Explain why

First, nearly all my friends and I have the same interset in foraging for delicious food. We have a wide range of appetites, including not only Chinese cuisine but also Japanese and Thailand cuisine. 
Second, resturant is a ideal place for chatting. After finishing dinner, we usually sit for hours to talk about what happens recently and recall the happy time we had together in school.

13. Do you like to eat at home or at the resturant? Which do you prefer and give the reasons
- I prefer to eat at resturant. 
First, When eating at resturant, we have a wide range of choices. We can eat diverse kinds of food from all over the world in resturant, including Japanese Cuisine and Thailand Cuisine. It's not possible for me to eat those cuisine at home. Moreover, I am not good at cooking. Comparing with the delicious food cooked by professional resturant, what I cooked can not be called food. 
Second, I am not interested in cooking at home, nor do I good at it. Some people might consider cooking a way to relax, but definitely not me included. Every time I cooked, I felt time was wasted. It would be more pleasant if I spend the same time on reading or watching TV. 

14. Describe a public area that you visit frequently? Please state why you visit frequently and give examples
- The public area I visited frequently is the campus library, actually I spend most of the day time there. The campus library is a quiet place so that I can concentrate on studying and cope with multi-thread tasks. At there, I won't be distracted from work by noise or some people. On the other hand, there are lots of magazines and fiction books available in library. When I feel tried and want to take a break from study, I would like to take a magazine for entertainment.

15. Some students prefer to choose universities located in big cities, others like to study in universities located in small towns. Please state your opinion and explain why.
- In my perspective, I woudl like to attend the universities which located in big cities. 
First, internship and part time job are significant parts of college life. Locating in big cities provide lots of working opportunities. Moreover, the students who already get intern or part time jobs dont have to rent house additionally or spend lots of time on transportation.
Second, students would have more choices when they want to relax at weekends. In big cities, theater, museum, large amounts of resturant, and nearly all public facilities are available 

16. Usually, novels, magazines and poetry are considered the three major literature. Which one do you prefer and explain why you prefer this literature form.
- Personally speaking, I would like novels.  First, reading novels, especially science fiction, is my own way to release pressure and entertain myself. I have been keeping reading novels since I was in high school. At that time, intensive study put a lot of stress on me, and reading novels in weekends helped to prevent me from depression. When reading novels, I felt I was in a world that the novels pictured, a world away from reality, a world that I didn't to concern about my study. 
Second, as far as I know, a huge amount of great literatures in world were written in novel form, such as Les Miserables authored by Victor Hugo and Hamlet authored by Shakespeare. Reading that kind of novels is more than entertainment, it also train me to think critically by trying to figure out what does the author want to convey in their novels. 

17. Some students tend to live alone, while others may want to share rooms with their roommates. Which way of living
- In my perpective, living with roommates is better for students. First, it comes economically, when sharing with roommates, it costs less rent. If a apartment costs 400 dollars per month, after sharing with one roommate, you only need to pay 200 dollars, which slashing half of the cost.
Second, it's necessary for us to learn to live in harmony with others and make some friends, and living with roommates is a good way to achieve these goals. You will have more chance to know other people feeling and what they think about you, by been a member of the group.
Third, if we have roommates, we can take care of each other. I can still recall one thing happened in my college age. One day I got a fever, one of my roomate bought medicines for me and kindly reminded me of taking pills in time.

18. When you are together with friends, which place do you prefer to eat, resturant, cafe or at home?
- When I am together with friends, we would like to eat at resturant. First, we have a variety of choices when eating at resturant, including not only Chinese Cuisine, but also Japnese, Korean and Thailand Cuisines. Both my friends and I are quite interested in foraging for different knids of delicous food from all over the world.
Second, I am not good at cooking and nor do I want to spend time on cooking at home. Some people may consider cooking a way to relax themselvies, but this is not the case for me. I would find it wasting time and bored to cook and clean the kitchen. I prefer to spending time with my friends on play computer games and sports.

19. Some believe that computer have improved our life while other think it cause a variety of problem
- Personally, I definitely belive computer have imporve our life.  It's believed by some people that computer lead a new industrial revolution of informatization, including internet and Artificial Intelligence. It reduced the information asymmetry around the world. You can search out nearlly everything you want to know by google. It's quite convinient for people like me that full of curiosity.
Critics may say, computer makes a huge amount of teenagers addicted to computer games. But I argued that it's not the tool itself but the person who use it in wrong way to blame. The goverment should make regulations to solve the problem it caused.

20. Describle the characteristics of a good teacher.
- In my perspective, being a good teach requires the following characterristics. First, be fair. As a person, it's noraml to like or dislike some of the students. But it's unfair to involve your personally emotion into class. Such as being harsh to those students who don't perform well. It might discourage them and make them feel unconfident.
Second, be supportive. A good teacher should concern students' mental heath as well as their grades. Juvenile can be sensitive and easily get depressed beacuse of immature mind. It's teacher's responsibility to avoid students doing something hurts themself or commit suicide.

21 Some people prefer to work at office while other would like to work at home.

22. Who is the person that you admire most?

23. Some people believe higher education is for all students. Other people believe it only suits for certain students.
