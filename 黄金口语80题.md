does it really see.

The goverment leader also gave an speech to state the great achievement our nation had made in last decades. When I was watching the celebration, I felt proud of being a Chinese.
But, Ironically, the same day in HK, some rioters marched said it's a shame day of HK. They felt humiliated to be identified as Chinese citizens. It's a nation somewhat divided.

8. Which one acts more influence on you? Newspaper, TV or teachers

And that's how most of theaters and museums were build in China, constructed by local goverment. The responsibility of goverment is to benefit citizens in all aspects. Theater and museum servers as the public benefit facilities to preserve arts and history. Our people need to learn history and arts as well as sciences. On the other hand, some theater and museum don't make a lot profits. Companies and private organization might not willing to spending money on constructing them. If goverment dont do a favor to assist in building them, there would not less and less public benefit facilities (of them)

Second, I am not interested in cooking at home, nor do I good at it. Some people might consider cooking a way to relax, but definitely not me included. Every time I cooked, I felt time was wasted. It would be more pleasant if I spend the same time on reading or watching TV.

Second, students would have more choices when they want to relax at weekends. In big cities, theater, museum, large amounts of resturant, and nearly all public facilities are available
