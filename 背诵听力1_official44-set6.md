Renewable Energey Sources

Now there's growing interest these days for generating electricity from renewable sources, from developing wind farms to tapping into an underground source of geothermal energy.

When you are consider a new project, is important to consider the costs, as well as the benefits, of developing that energy source.

Let me give you a example of that kind of thing I am talking about.

That's currently a lot of interest in harnessing the power of oceans, of the ocean tides. that's... the movement of huge amounts water which causes the water level to rise and fall.

The idea is if we can harness that tidal energy, it would be a great, clean, renewable energy source.

A place that tidal energy can be harnessed is at a shallow body of water, such as an estuary

Now, can anyone tell me what a estuary is?

Yes, Ted
An estuary is where a river enters the ocean, the fresh water meets the ocean water. Sometime it's covered by water, sometime it's not.

Some parts of the estuary, as the tide goes in and out, but other parts are always submerged.

Estuaries are ideal place to try to capture energy from changes in tides, beacuse there's an exceptional large difference between the water level at high tide and at low tide.

All that movements generate a lot of energy. and one way to harness that energy is by building a structure called a barrage there.

A barrage is basically a  large low dam but built accross the estuary, when the tides go in and out, the moving water flows through the tunnels of the barrage.

So you have huge amounts of water trying to flow through these relatively small tunnels. and that turns turbines that generate electricity.

Now these estuaries are important beacuse of their high level of biological productivity. They are home to lots of fish, birds and other marine life. So when you propose to build a barrage, you have a lot of issues to consider.

For example, it would change the existing level waters of the estuary. Since a lot of water is getting held up by the barrage, the incoming tides won't go as high. but they wouldn't be as low during low tide, either.

It might help prevent flooding, but it also affect the mud flats. Those areas are normally exposed when the tide recedes

But don't lots of birds rely on exposed mud flats for food? I mean, don't they eat tiny animals live in the mud. And what about those animals.

What would happen to them if the mud flats are endangered.

So you are seeing some of the potential problems of building a barrages. But consider this. 

Right now, the water in an estuary is very cloudy. The tidal currents are constantly churning the sediments that rivers deposit in the estuary.

But the barrage would reduce the tidal currents, so a lot of sediment would settle to the floor of the estuary. I wouldn't get stirred up so much.

The water would be clearer. Allowing more sunlight to reach deeper into the water. which might lead to more food for birds and animals, attracting new wildlife to the area. So it's a complicated environmental picture..

Have they try this anywhere? Build a barrage there?

Yes, there are several in operation, there's one in France.
They have to be very careful about how they turn on the turbines. Beacuse they create currents and waves that can affect boats.

But I haven't read any major ecological problems, in fact, the fishing is supposed to have improved. Plus, there's even more bird life.

But some of the barrages we are considering now would be much larger than that one

There's been one proposed for the estuary of Great Britain's Seven River. One of the largest estuaries in the world

It would be 16 kilometers long, just give you an idea, the barrage in France is less than one kilometer.

Outside of environmental concerns, such a project would be hugely expensive. and that's another argument against barrages

Critics say it would be better to use that money for something else, such as improving the efficency of building. You can make a lot of buildings more efficient with all that money and that would reduce the need for electricity
